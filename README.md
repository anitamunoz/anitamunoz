- 👋 Hi, I’m @anitamunoz 
- 👀 I’m interested in social sciences in general, that's why I'm currently studying _Licenciatura en Ciencias de la Comunicación_ which will translate to something like comunication sciences. However, I'm fascinated about programming cause my dad is into that world haha.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from a free girl-programmers club provided by Globant
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I'm prepared to!
- 📫 How to reach me: my instagram account: @anita_munoz_ :)
